# Diabetes Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This repository contains a Python script for diabetes classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The code leverages the popular scikit-learn library for machine learning.

## Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The script starts with data preprocessing, including data standardization using StandardScaler.

SVM Classification: It employs a Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel for binary classification to predict diabetes outcomes.

Train and Test: The dataset is split into a training set and a test set to evaluate model performance.

Accuracy Measurement: The code calculates and displays the accuracy of the SVM model on both the training and test data.

Prediction: You can also make predictions for diabetes status on new data samples.

## Dataset:

The code uses the "diabetes.csv" dataset to train and test the SVM model. The dataset is commonly used for diabetes classification tasks.

Usage:

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for diabetes classification projects or as an example of implementing SVM for binary classification.

## Dependencies:

1. NumPy

2. Pandas

3. scikit-learn (sklearn)
